- When a hyphae dies, automatically create a new one (maybe with a fadeout and a title)
- Get rid of what Filipa calls the apple core: tendency to have more hypha in the 4 diagonals
- The Hypha deathBorder must be calculated based on its actual position and only on its initial direction (or we'll end up with a circle anyway)
- Review Hypha nextForkDistance
- Convert other settings into sets

- Try to make Hyphae looks not depend on its growth speed


- Add circle mask?
- Save set of parameters to file?
- Load set of parameters from file?
