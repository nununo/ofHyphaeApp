- Get rid of apple core: tendency to have more hypha in the 4 diagonals. But how?
- Consider making Hypha speed proportional to its distance from the center
- Allow to fade to black also

- Replace Hyphae.removeAllHypha() with a dieEvent. This way much less time is wasted asking every single Hypha if it is alive

- Better death (which fills the whole area inside the border)

- Try to make Hyphae looks not depend on its growth speed

- Same params still don't generate the exact same Hypha

- Review Hypha nextForkDistance

- Convert other settings into sets

- Save set of parameters to file?
- Load set of parameters from file?
