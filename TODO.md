- Introduce parameter which allows for black saturation
- Convert other settings into sets
- The Hypha deathBorder must be calculated based on its actual position and only on its initial direction (or we'll end up with a circle anyway)

- Save set of parameters to file
- Load set of parameters from file
- Review Hypha nextForkDistance
- Try to make Hyphae looks not depend on its growth speed
- Add circle mask and center Hyphae?
