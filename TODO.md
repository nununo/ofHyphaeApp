- Fade to black still not ok. It is not smooth

- Get rid of apple core: tendency to have more hypha in the 4 diagonals. But how?
- Better death (which fills the whole area inside the border)

- Consider making Hypha speed proportional to its distance from the center
- Same params still don't generate the exact same Hypha (it seems to be related to roundings)
- pixelOverlap isn't working well and somehow a lot of pixels are skipped

- Save set of parameters to file?
- Load set of parameters from file?
