- Get rid of apple core: tendency to have more hypha in the 4 diagonals. But how?
- Consider making Hypha speed proportional to its distance from the center
- Allow fade to white also

- Better death (which fills the whole area inside the border)

- Same params still don't generate the exact same Hypha (it seems to be related to roundings)

- Save set of parameters to file?
- Load set of parameters from file?
- Convert other settings into sets
- Replace Hyphae.removeAllHypha() with a dieEvent. This way much less time is wasted asking every single Hypha if it is alive
