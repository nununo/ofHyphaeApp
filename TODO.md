- Hypha speed proportional to its death border distance (so it doesn't grow as a circle)
- Try to make Hyphae looks not depend on its growth speed
- Make Conidium create more pixels per frame (since we now have 10fps)
- Add circle mask
- Detect other hyphae?

- Use realistic Conidia colors
- Conidia: use 3D perlin noise to move between 3 colors (2 seems poor)
